# NS Quiz ([demo](http://sanderjurgens.github.io/ns-quiz))
## What is it?
NS Quiz is a simple game to test your knowledge of the Dutch Railways, specifically the [NS](https://www.ns.nl/en). 
There are separate quiz categories for Dutch station name abbreviations, Dutch train series and NS rolling stock numbers.

## Why did I make it?
Since I started my job within the operational heart of the Dutch Railways, I noticed a lot of technical jargon was being used to communicate in the workplace. 
To better understand all the abbreviations and numbers, I developed this quiz to train my knowledge on the subject. 
Perhaps this quiz will help others, as it has helped me.
